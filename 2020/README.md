# advent-of-code-2020

My solutions for Advent Of Code in 2020. They'll be written in Scala or Rust.

Note: By default, this time I'm solving these as fast as I can, so they'll likely be implemented
in almost-functional Scala (side effects like reading the file will be permitted without suspension) in a Metals worksheet.
Please don't judge my sick FP skillz by these.
